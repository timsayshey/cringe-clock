# Cringe Clock - ADHD Pomodoro for the Wildly Distractible üïíü§™

Welcome to **Cringe Clock** - the Pomodoro timer that's so in-your-face, you can't help but stay on track. Designed with the distractible, the procrastinators, and the "oh look, a butterfly!" crowd in mind. If you've ever found yourself three hours deep into a Wikipedia rabbit hole or spent 4 hours making another stupid pomodoro (like I just did) when you were supposed to be working, this is for you.

## What is This Madness? ü§î

Cringe Clock is not your grandma's Pomodoro timer. It's a ticking, flashing, always-on-top reminder that time is slipping away, and you should probably be doing something more productive than you are right now.

### DEMO

https://github.com/timsayshey/cringe-clock/assets/1148940/dfba60bf-d612-47f8-abaf-9542b457010e


### Features

- **Always On Top**: Like the most annoying friend who won't let you bail on gym day, Cringe Clock stays in your face.
- **Flashing UI**: Subtlety is not our thing. The UI flashes to keep your wandering eyes glued to the task. Warning for those with health conditions sensitive to flashing lights.
- **Ticking Sound**: Because nothing says "get to work" like the relentless sound of a ticking clock.
- **ADHD-Friendly**: Specifically designed for those who need a little (read: a lot) of extra push to stay focused.
- **Customizable**: Because even the easily distracted have preferences.

## Getting Started üöÄ

Cringe Clock is built with Vue and Electron, because we believe in using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/timsayshey/cringe-clock.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd cringe-clock
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (yes, it has those):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the madness**:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## How to Contribute ü§ù

Got an idea to make Cringe Clock even more absurdly over-the-top? Forks and PRs are welcome. This project thrives on chaos and caffeine.

### Wishlist:

- Mute button for flashing only
- More sound annoying sounds to choose from
- Current task textfield with checkbox with a list of completed tasks (persisted between launches)

## Finally

Remember, Cringe Clock is designed to be annoyingly helpful. It's not a bug; it's a feature!
